        I was born on the&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay">
          Chesapeake Bay
        </a>, and educated at&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.smcm.edu/">St. Mary's College of Southern Maryland
        </a>. Not quite sure what to do with my life, I joined
        the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.uscg.mil/">US Coast Guard</a>. Still
        unsure, I went to&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">Korea</a>
        &nbsp;to teach English, where I completed my online Master's in
        Psychology with&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.ncu.edu/">NCU</a> that I
        began in the Coast Guard.

        It was in using Oblivion mods that I discovered I enjoyed technical
        challenges. I didn't get into creating my own mods...although&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28452">one simple change
        I made</a>&nbsp;was downloaded almost 3,000 times. However, back in
        2009, getting hundreds of mods to work together without crashing the
        game or creating all sorts of weird problems was a major challenge.
        Whenever something didn't work, I knew there had to be a
        specific reason why. Not knowing drove me crazy, and I would work on it
        all day, often forgetting to eat, until I found the answer.

        So I began using Linux on the desktop out of curiosity--which
        I know that was some time around 2010, as Maverick Meerkat was my first
        Ubuntu release. I dabbled in Bash scripting and Python programming for
        fun.

        I always had an intense &nbsp;<a href=
          "http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths/Love-of-Learning"
        >love of learning</a>&nbsp; and &nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths/Curiosity"
        >curiosity</a>; I read encyclopedia articles as a child for
        entertainment, and I read more textbooks after graduating college than
        while I was in college. Those traits, combined with my logical mind,
        have served me well as a self-taught programmer.

        I had been saying for years that I would major in computer
        science if I could do it over again. In need of a new career,
        realizing I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in Korea, I
        decided there was no time like the present. I have been studying web
        development for almost a year now.
